# StochasticNachos
For Computer Vision: I hope by using this the first part of reading in the images, resizing images, one hot encoding, normalizing images and flattening images will become trivial.
Once you import this package all you need to do is set up your paths and then you can simply call functions.
Please see the driverSN.py for an example on how to use StochasticNachos. 
I hope this helps. 

Faraz.
