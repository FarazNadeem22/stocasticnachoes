This library is designed for computer vision projects. This library or package will help you read in your files if they are located in a classifed directory setting. It will make reading images from those directory  into x test, train and validate trivial. It wil also plot sample images to make sure that images have been properly read into you program. It will also normalize the imainges and do the needed one hot encoding. If you look at the file called driverSN.py you can see how to use the functions. I will keep looking back to see if I can make improvements. I hope this will help people improve their models as they would not need to spend a lot of time trying to work on stuff that is for the most part repeditave yet takes up a lot of time. 

## Good Luck
