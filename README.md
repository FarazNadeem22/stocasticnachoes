# StochasticNachos
For Computer Vision: 
Readin images, resizing images, one hot encoding, normalizing images and flattening images if needed.
Once you import this package all you need to do is set up your pants and then you can simply call functions.
Please see the driverSN.py for an example on how to use StochasticNachos. 
I hope this helps.
